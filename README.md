# 👨‍💻 Gagan Bhuva – AI/ML Automation | DevOps | System Builder

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m deeply interested in **automating research and development workflows** using **AI/ML**, systems engineering, and modern DevOps practices. I’m constantly learning how to combine intelligent agents, Python tooling, and scalable infrastructure to build fully automated pipelines—from data ingestion to deployment.

---

## 🚀 Interests

- **AI/ML Automation Agents**  
  Designing intelligent agents that automate entire research or development workflows.

- **Python Systems Engineering**  
  Building Python-based OS components, package managers, and low-level tooling (e.g., Pony OS, CPython byte-level control).

- **DevOps & Cloud Native**  
  Automating infrastructure with Docker, Kubernetes, and declarative CI/CD using tools like Dagger.

- **Workflow Orchestration**  
  Combining tools like Celery, Redis, Zulip, and Django to build distributed task management systems.

- **Security and Authentication**  
  Experience with JWT, LDAP, Keycloak, secure APIs, and ISO 27001:2022 best practices.

## 📘 What I’ve Learned So Far

### 🐍 Python Ecosystem
- Deep understanding of Python internals for performance and packaging.
- Built custom package manager logic with dependency merging and optimization (GBPACKER).
- Asynchronous Python: Celery with Redis, Django integration, task queuing.

### 🧠 AI/ML Workflow Automation
- Structured approach to automate data-to-deployment pipelines using LLMs and open-source tools.
- Knowledge of prompt chaining, scriptable LLM agents, and integrating AI into traditional DevOps.

### ☁️ DevOps / Infrastructure
- Proficient with:
  - **Docker & Docker Compose**: Multi-container setup, volume/network configs.
  - **Kubernetes**: YAML-based deployments, service scaling, zero-downtime rollouts.
  - **Dagger**: Declarative CI/CD pipelines using code.
- Deployment of production services on VMs with monitoring and logging.
- API Gateway setup with **APISIX** for routing and scaling.

### 🗣️ Communication Between Systems
- Integrated Zulip bots for updates.
- Created async workflows using Django + Celery + Redis.
- Experience configuring RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, and TURN/STUN services.

### 🔐 Auth Systems
- Configured and troubleshot JWT, LDAP, and Keycloak.
- Auth flows in services like Jitsi Meet, Razorpay, and Grafana.

### 🎥 Jitsi Meet Customization
- Full Docker-based deployment and troubleshooting.
- Experience with:
  - `token_affiliation` plugin
  - Moderator logic bugs and Jicofo config deep dive
  - Integrating Etherpad, Whiteboard, TURN/STUN

## 📌 Current Focus

- Designing fully automated R&D pipelines using LLMs.
- Finalizing GBPACKER for dependency merging and optimization.
- Building `Pony OS`, a Python-first OS environment.
- Extending Kubernetes knowledge to include Operators, Helm, and GitOps.
- Launching Coders Army: a collaborative community of automation-focused devs.

## 🧠 Vision

To make AI-powered, automated research and development a default—not a luxury. I want to make tools that let any developer or researcher automate what normally takes days, in minutes—with auditability, reliability, and speed.
